* Step 11: to submit solutions send pull requests from your fork via github.com to [selfie-master](https://github.com/cksystemsteaching/CC-Summer-2016/tree/selfie-master)

General Requirements

Assignment 0: Your Team!
------------------------

__Deadline__: March 10, 10am (hard, no extensions)

Suppose your team name is *TheCompilables*. Change selfie such that it prints "This is TheCompilables Selfie" in a separate line on the console before doing anything else. All other functionality should be unaffected.
